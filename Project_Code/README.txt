This File will contain helpful information on how to access my files for the project.

1)
In my "Driver.java", I have successfully passed all of the built-in tests that were commented on. For the potential extra credit, I created a
The text file named "results.txt" contains the vending machine storage after removing and adding certain items. 

2)
I did apply polymorphism to my code, and this should show if you had test input where you wanted to put different types of items into the 
same directory in the vending machine. 

3)
When running my "Driver.java", it will print one line of comments to the console. This is on purpose. If you were to comment he part-out
of writing the new file and uncommenting the testing of the code outside the writing file, the comment printed to the console is in a proper
place regards the outputs we are looking at.

4)
In my vending machine built by JavaFX, I kept it very simple. There is a button to fill the vending machine, and then when you click the 
vending machine buttons, the count of the items goes down by one. There shouldn't be any errors thrown, assuming the input for the vending
machine is less than or equal to 8.
